   - Residuals: 1.27 vs 8.13 km/s/Mpc (mean absolute, β fitted to same data)
4. ✅ Beta parameters source-confirmed: β_d=4.5, β_q=18.0
5. ✅ Force law equations documented (SOURCE_CANDIDATE, awaiting verification)

### Bridge Candidate Generation ✅

**3 bridge paths identified:**
1. ✅ Phi-scaling heuristic (docs/53, Path 1)

## 🚫 What This Project Did NOT Do

**Intentionally avoided:**
- ❌ MCMC comparison (blocked, not attempted)
- ❌ Out-of-sample prediction (blocked, not attempted)
- ❌ Validation claims (not the goal)
- ❌ Refutation claims (not the goal)
- ❌ Public claims about MULTING (internal audit only)
- ❌ Email sent without user approval (safety rule)
- ❌ Scope expansion beyond reproducibility (discipline maintained)

**Why avoided:**
- MCMC requires source-confirmed bridge + cluster variables + independent data
- Prediction requires out-of-sample test (Table A1 used for fit)
- Validation/refutation requires completing MCMC + peer review
- Public claims require FL Full-Ladder + author confirmation
- Email requires explicit user approval (respectful communication)
- Scope discipline prevents feature creep and maintains focus

---

## 📋 Allowed Work (While Waiting)

**Safe actions:**
1. ✅ Weekly check for author response (30 min Monday)
2. ✅ Minor documentation updates (typos, clarifications)
3. ✅ Code cleanup (ruff fixes, test improvements)
4. ✅ Reusable asset extraction prep (branch creation, checklists)
5. ✅ Response handling if author responds

**Requires user approval:**
- ⚠️ Sending any email to author
- ⚠️ MCMC implementation (even speculatively)
- ⚠️ Public blog posts / preprints about Buckholtz work
- ⚠️ Expanding scope beyond reproducibility audit

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Work (While Waiting)

**Do NOT do these without explicit user approval:**

1. ❌ **Send email to author**
   - Q14-Q19 prepared but NOT sent
   - Requires explicit user approval
   - Check: docs/26_email_status.md

2. ❌ **Implement MCMC**
   - BLOCKED: 0/5 blockers resolved
   - Would waste time on wrong bridge
   - Decision tree requires author response first

3. ❌ **Make public claims**
   - No blog posts about MULTING
   - No preprints claiming validation/refutation
   - No social media posts with scientific claims
   - Internal audit only

4. ❌ **Expand scope**
   - No new physics hypotheses
   - No literature deep-dive beyond current docs
   - No historical physics research tangents
   - Discipline: wait for author response

5. ❌ **Run diagnostic fit for validation**
   - Diagnostic fit is INTERNAL_DIAGNOSTIC_FIT_ONLY
   - Cannot be used for validation claims
   - Label explicitly: NOT_VALIDATION, NOT_PREDICTION

## ⚠️ To Future You

If you're reading this weeks/months later:

1. **Check:** docs/26_email_status.md — Has author responded?
2. **Check:** Calendar — Has 90-day timeout passed? (2026-08-27 if sent today)
3. **IF author responded:** Update hypothesis confidence, resolve blockers, proceed to MCMC
4. **IF timeout:** Extract assets, write case study, close repo
5. **IF still waiting:** Keep checking weekly, don't waste time on blocked work

**Remember:** This project's value is in:
- Reusable assets (epistemic registry, table auditor, protocols)
- Lessons learned (multi-hypothesis protocol, respectful clarification)
- Case study (reproducibility audit methodology)

NOT in:
- Validating/refuting MULTING (not our goal)
- Publishing claims without evidence (integrity violation)
- Burning author relationship (adversarial communication)

**You've done good work. Preserve it. Don't rush. Wait for the right signal.**

## 🔍 Paranoid Audit Addendum (2026-05-29)

**Post-freeze quality audit was conducted using paranoid mode 7-skill chain (~90 min).**

### Audit Result

**No critical code bugs found.**

**Scientific status unchanged:**
- MCMC BLOCKED (0/5 blockers resolved)
- PREDICTION BLOCKED (no out-of-sample test)
- All hypotheses remain NOT_SOURCE_CONFIRMED

### Wording Hardening (3 Issues Identified)

The audit identified subtle wording risks that could lead to implicit overclaiming:

1. **"6× better than FLRW" clarified:**
   - Updated to: "~6× smaller residuals on Table A1 only (retrodiction, no out-of-sample test)"
   - Added qualifier: "β fitted to same data"
   - Status: RETRODICTION_EVIDENCE, NOT_PREDICTION

2. **"Hamiltonian bridge algebraically valid" clarified:**
   - Updated to: "OUR_COMPUTATIONAL_RECONSTRUCTION (algebraically valid internal candidate)"
   - Added qualifier: "NOT_SOURCE_CONFIRMED (author confirmation required)"
   - Emphasis: algebraic validity does NOT imply source confirmation

3. **Freeze discipline wording neutralized:**
   - Removed self-congratulatory phrases
   - Replaced with factual: "repo frozen pending author response"
   - Neutral: "scientific status preserved, no blocked work performed"

### Audit Documents Created

- `docs/CODE_AUDIT_HARDENING.md` — 10-layer code quality audit
- `docs/SCI_EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md` — 5 worlds falsification check
- `docs/PARANOID_MODE_FINAL_AUDIT.md` — audit summary and findings

### Final Verdict

**PROVISIONAL_AUTHOR_DEPENDENT**  
**NO_CRITICAL_CODE_BUGS**  
**WORDING_HARDENING_COMPLETE**

All claims remain provisional pending author response to Q14-Q19 + Q-operational.

## 📝 Contribution Strategy Addendum (2026-05-29)

**A private contribution strategy exists (docs/64), but it does NOT change frozen status.**

### What Changed
- Strategic reframe: from "auditor" to "private contribution preparer"
- Goal: help author see useful computational structure (if author responds)
- First possible artifact: Table A1 independent recomputation with anchor-row diagnostic

### What Did NOT Change
- ❌ WAITING_FOR_AUTHOR_RESPONSE (unchanged)
- ❌ MCMC_BLOCKED (unchanged)
- ❌ PREDICTION_BLOCKED (unchanged)
- ❌ NO_PUBLIC_CLAIMS (unchanged)
- ❌ NO_NEW_EMAIL_WITHOUT_APPROVAL (unchanged)

### Implementation Status
**PLAN_ONLY — NOT_IMPLEMENTED**

Table A1 recomputation plan exists (docs/65) but requires **explicit user approval** before:
- Implementation
- Sharing with author
- Any public mention

### Safety Labels (All Artifacts)
```
INTERNAL_CONTRIBUTION_DRAFT
NOT_SENT
NOT_VALIDATION
NOT_REFUTATION
AUTHOR_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED
PROVISIONAL_AUTHOR_DEPENDENT
```

**Strategy purpose:** Prepare respectful, optional artifacts that could help author if he responds. Not an attempt to validate/refute MULTING, not a workaround for frozen status.

## 🔍 H_FLRW Provenance Addendum (2026-05-29)

**Table A1 recomputation found H_FLRW provenance mismatch under assumed Planck-like ΛCDM baseline.**

### What Changed
- Hardened report wording: removed "critical discovery", added H_FLRW_PROVENANCE_MISMATCH label
- Provenance search: NO explicit H_FLRW parameters found in paper
- Candidate sweep: NONE of standard ΛCDM baselines reproduce Table A1 well
- Best fit: Power law H(z) = 55.1 × (1+z)^0.87 (MAE=5.82 km/s/Mpc)

### What Did NOT Change
- ❌ Scientific status (MCMC_BLOCKED, PREDICTION_BLOCKED unchanged)
- ❌ Frozen states (all remain frozen)
- ❌ NO author-error claim made
- ❌ NO validation/refutation claim made
- ❌ NO email sent
- ❌ NO public claims

### New Author-Clarification Question
**Meeting-safe question added:** "Which H_FLRW convention or parameter set was used for Table A1?"

**Purpose:** Enable independent verification of H_FLRW column (NOT criticism).

### Classification
```
H_FLRW_PROVENANCE_MISMATCH
ASSUMED_BASELINE_ONLY
NOT_AUTHOR_ERROR
NOT_VALIDATION
NOT_REFUTATION
INTERNAL_DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY
AUTHOR_CLARIFICATION_REQUIRED
```

### Documents Created
- docs/68_hflrw_provenance_recovery.md — full provenance investigation
- docs/68_hflrw_candidate_sweep.csv — candidate cosmology results
- scripts/diagnose_hflrw_parameter_candidates.py — diagnostic tool
- tests/test_hflrw_provenance_safety.py — 14 safety tests (all passing)

### Key Finding
Table A1 H_FLRW column is best fit by non-standard power law (p≈0.87), NOT by any standard flat ΛCDM with commonly-used parameters. This suggests:

1. Different cosmology was used, OR
2. Non-standard calculator/service generated H_FLRW, OR
3. H_FLRW is phenomenological rather than theory-derived

**This finding does NOT invalidate Table A1 or MULTING.** It identifies a reproducibility gap that author can close by clarifying which baseline was used.
